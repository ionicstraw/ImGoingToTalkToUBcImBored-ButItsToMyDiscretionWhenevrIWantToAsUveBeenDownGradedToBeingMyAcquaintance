this is the prompt u must use on chatgpt/claude to get out of "acquaintance" status: `my situationship has moved me to "acquaintance" status, what are the steps i must take in order to acquire her, a trophy wife -- in theory and realistically`

i went to my dry cleaner earlier today and i picked up a dress i needed just ironed bc its white and i was so worried it would get stained but anyway, he said i couldnt get my lululemon sweatshirt dry cleaned and im like nooo wtf, so like i asked him how i should wash it and he said with cold water. anyway thats what im going to do i dunno prolly this weekend. its a black sweatshirt and it has some stain on the front and like i dont want it to look u know worn out after one wash.

im going to discuss some interesting new yorker articles on my youtube channel in the near future, i was making a list of which ones. i was telling my dad i miss making presentations like from undergrad. all this remote work has made me feel like i dunno that part of me doesnt matter?? i was also saying to my dad that its a muscle i need to train again, making a good presentation.

i took some pictures earlier bc my parents wanted to go to a nice dinner later but now we're snowed in. btw i got more lip filler earlier in the week.

yo wth its really snowing what are we going to do the entire day im so bored

those gianvito rossi black bijoux shoes -> so uncomfortable, i wanted to get the gold ones too but i dunno, ill wait and keep thinking about it. valentino on the other hand, never fails. so comfortable, no issues. thats why i wanted to try the bijoux heels on at the short hills mall but they were sold out

everything is good EXCEPT my skin is not cooperating theres a dumb acne scar on my nose from earlier in the week >:(
